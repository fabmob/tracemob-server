<h2>emTripLog: supporting studies on human travel</h2>
This app is a generalization of the e-mission open source platform
(https://github.com/e-mission/) intended to support research studies around
travel behavior. While the initial platform development was at the University
of California, Berkeley, this app is no longer affliated with the university.
It is provided by the primary developer (K. Shankari, shankari -at- damajash.org) as
a service to the research community.
<p>
This app automatically, in the background, tracks your location,
accelerometer, device-generated activity recognition and battery usage.
It uses this data to automatically generate a travel diary and
display it to you. It also allows you to optionally annotate the travel
diary with richer details or with experience information.
When you launch the app, it logs information about your phone type
(android/iOS), make, model and version. This metadata helps the developer to
correlate app problems with specific phones (e.g.  https://dontkillmyapp.com/)
Since our code is open source, you can inspect the data the app collects in <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">our repo</a>.
<p>
After you join the study, the app will display a study-specific consent
document which will outline study-specific data handling and sharing
procedures. Please read it carefully. Background tracking will start only after
you accept the study-specific consent document. The researcher conducting the
study may choose to compensate you for your time, as described in the
study-specific consent document.
<p>
If you have any questions about this app, please contact the lead
developer (K. Shankari, shankari@damajash.org). If you have questions about the
study you are participating in, please contact the researcher who asked you to install the app.

If you agree to join the study, scan the QR code or click on the link to
proceed. If you do not wish to join the study, please
uninstall the app.
